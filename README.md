# Abstract
We developed a flexible Bayesian framework that used the copulas to joint modeling terminal and recurrent event process. A flexible frailtyâ€“copula model under the Bayesian framework was proposed. 

# Highlights
- Parameter estimate: 
- Brier Score calculation in dynamic prediction

# Usage
- R code for parameter estimation using JHCM
- R code for parameter estimation using TVHCM
- R code for Brier Score calculation
